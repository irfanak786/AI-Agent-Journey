This repository documents my journey of learning and building AI agents from scratch. Starting as a complete beginner, I am mastering essential Python skills and gradually moving towards developing intelligent agents. Follow my progress, see my projects, and join me in this exciting adventure!
# My First AI Agent - Trash Bin Cleaner

Hi! This is my first ever project learning about AI agents. I'm building an agent that can clean up a virtual trash bin.  It's a simple project to help me understand how AI agents work.

The agent learns to pick up different kinds of trash. I'm using Python for the code.  The main file is called `trash_bin_cleaner.py`.

I'm still learning, but I'm hoping to make the agent pretty good at cleaning up!  This project is helping me learn the basics of how to train an AI.

I'll keep adding to this as I learn more.  Wish me luck!
